In the world of computer science students the importance of data structures 
and algorithms has been repeatedly beaten into us. To be fair our teachers
and mentors are correct. However being correct dosn't make wisdom less 
painful.

### Project goals
I have programmed in c++ for the mojority of by development time. This does 
not mean that I know much about c++. So this project is again an opportunity to 
learn about c++. In c++ fashion I do not want to manage memory without the STL 
however, I would like to use it in a minimal way. Obviously all of the simple 
data structures I will be implementing will have the same behavior as several 
STL things. My implementations will be worse and have less features (obviously). 
This is for education, primarily mine.


I love Makefiles, but Makefiles are also infuriating. I will use this project 
as a way to learn more about CMake.


My biggest developer confession is im not very good at git, this is mostly due 
to lazyness or excitement (kinda the same thing when talking codeing). I will 
try to make smaller commits, and use git to a fuller extent.

### Caveat's
I may leave some enironment configs in some commits for later reference. For
example I use the clang formatter and I am still not happy with my config.

### Final note
Im sorry father I am not very good at programming. Please forgive me.
